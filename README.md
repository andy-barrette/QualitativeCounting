Ever heard of autistic people who can count large numbers of things instantaneously? Well, the point of this program is to see if that ability is trainable.

This version was an attempt to convert a prior ASCII-based version to OpenGL. Since the ASCII-based version worked, I think this version must be not far from finished, but I left it in an unfinished state and can't remember where I left off. Apparently the Intro screen isn't displaying and the logic is all broken.
